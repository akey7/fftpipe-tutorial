## What is fftpipe?

`fftpipe` is a package of functions that wrap around the base R [`fft()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/fft) function. The `fftpipe` package enables workflows around the [`fft()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/fft) function that use the pipe (`%>%`) operator. I took inspiration for the interface to `fftpipe` from the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) and [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org) packages.

Specifically, `fftpipe` offers the following functionality:

1. Waveform generation,
2. FFT and inverse FFT transformation,
3. Plotting of these waveforms and FFTs.

## Installation

Install `fftpipe` from GitHub with devtools. If you don't have devtools installed already, install it with `install.packages("devtools")`. Once devtools is installed, you can then install `fftpipe` by typing the following command into the R console:

```
devtools::install_github("akey7/fftpipe")
```
